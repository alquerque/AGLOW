# AGLOW
Automated Grid-Enabled LOFAR Workflows

AGLOW is a combination of the GRID LOFAR Reduction Tools and Apache Airflow. In order to efficiently use the Computational Resources provided to us at SURFsara, the AGLOW package includes custom Airflow Operators. These operators can be combined to build LOFAR workflows, from a single NDPPP run to full Direction Dependent Imaging.
